I am a high school student at a local science high school in Metro Manila, Philippines. As an amateur developer, I love solving problems that I never would've thought I'd come across. I aspire to be someone who can help others especially in software and general tech. *\<insert virtual handshake here 🥲🫱🏾‍🫲🏽\>*

* Tardy Scan 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓🏫
  * [Android port](https://github.com/unovil/TardyScan-Android)

**🌱 I’m currently learning:**

**⚡ Some facts about me:**
* At an all-you-can-eat grill, I ate a kilo of shrimp and had severe allergies the next day.
* I can speak broken German, on top of my fluent native languages -- English and Filipino. (still going strong at Duolingo!)
* Whistling and eating marshmallows are 2 things that you will *never* see me do. ever.
